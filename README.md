# Comparison of single-trace and multiple-trace polarity determination for surface microseismic data using deep learning

Introductionï¼š
We propose a multi-trace based CNN (MT-CNN) architecture to determine the P-wave first-motion polarity for 
surface microseismic data since the polarity of the recorded waveform of a microseismic event changes 
continuously across the array, while previous studies of polarity detection utilizes only individual trace
information.
